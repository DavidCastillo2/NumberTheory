# NumberTheory
The purpose of this project is to solve each problem step by step. This allows for both validation of your solutions along with spotting where an incorrect step was made. This also allows those that learn through patterns to see many problems solved at once to see how things flow for any of the given problems.
This code implements the following mathematical operations/solutions discussed in Number Theory taught at NCF:

1.  GCD (Greatest Common Denominator)
2.  Chinese Remainder Theorem
3.  Linear Combination
4.  Residue System
5.  Change a Number's Base
6.  Phi (Count of Integers Relatively Prime to Input)
7.  Tau (Count of Divisors for Input)
8.  Omega (Sum of Factors For N)
9.  Prime Factorization
10. RSA (exponential Cipher)
11. Ceaser Cipher
12. Inverse Modulo
13. Affine Transformations
